# Ehousing web3 project

This project is intended to demonstrate the ability to code, test, deploy and interact with an Ethereum contract.
The goal of the project is to create an escrow contract handling the interaction between an agency holding houses and tenants.


## Project structure
- Chain is the directory for all the Ethereum stuff
- Backend is the server side (web2) code, which is a WIP. It should be used to manage the static data of the contract.
